# Unleashing Realism: Mastering Synthetic Tabular Data Generation with CTGAN and SDV Python Libraries

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful for generating realistic synthetic Tabular data but many GANs are only suitable for Images. Why?

## Challenges of Generating Synthetic Tabular Data

* Mixed data types of discrete and continuous columns.
* Non-Gaussian distributions of Continuous values in tabular data
* Multimodal distributions of continuous columns.
* Sparse one-hot-encoded vectors
* Highly imbalanced categorical columns

## Existing GANs/VAE for Tabular Data

There are a few GANs, specially the one for time-series medical records such as medGAN, ehrGAN, tableGAN and PATE-GAN. Next to these, there are also types of variational autoencoder (VAE) like TVAE to be used.

Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN):

CTGANs seems to be the ideal solution. It has the following properties:

* mode-specific normalization
* architectural changes
* addressing data imbalance by employing a conditional generator and training-by-sampling
* performs significantly better than other GANs

## Python libraries related to SDV

ðŸ“š Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)

CTGANs is a part of SDV library. SDV is a Python library for creating tabular synthetic data. The SDV uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from your real data and emulate them in synthetic data.

ðŸ“š Synthetic Data Gym (SDGym)

SDGym is a benchmarking framework for modeling and generating synthetic data. Measure performance and memory usage across different synthetic data modeling techniques â€“ classical statistics, deep learning and more!

ðŸ“š SDMetrics

SDMetrics library evaluates synthetic data by comparing it to the real data that you're trying to mimic. It includes a variety of metrics to capture different aspects of the data, for example quality and privacy.

ðŸ“š Copulas

Copulas is a Python library for modeling multivariate distributions and sampling from them using copula functions. Given a table of numerical data, use Copulas to learn the distribution and generate new synthetic data following the same statistical properties.

ðŸ“š RDT (Reversible Data Transforms)

RDT is a Python library that transforms raw data into fully numerical data, ready for data science. The transforms are reversible, allowing you to convert from numerical data back into your original format.

ðŸ“š DeepEcho

DeepEcho is a Synthetic Data Generation Python library for mixed-type, multivariate time series.

ðŸ“š YData
Y Data synthetic library is also capable of synthesizing tabular Data and time series data
