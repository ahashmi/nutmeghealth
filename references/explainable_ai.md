In my previous post about Explainable AI (XAI) I talked about the phases of XAI and top 10 libraries. In this post together we delve into more Python libraries XAI characteristics, Categories, more Advanced XAI.

## Characteristics of XAI

* Transparency
* Justification
* Informativeness
* Reliability

## Categories of XAI

Feature attribution: Determine Feature Importance
Instance based: Determine Subset of features that guarantee a prediction
Graph Convolution based: Interpret Model using subgraphs
Self explaining: Develop Model that are explainable by Design
Uncertainty Estimation: Quantify the reliability of a prediction

## More Advanced AI

Diving into some examples in the categories and also other types:
Counterfactual: alternative scenarios that could have led to a different AI decision.
Human-Readable Rule Extraction: extract human-readable rules from complex models
Attention Mechanisms: highlight the important features or regions in input data that influenced an AI decision.
NLP techniques: can generate explanations in human-readable language to provide intuitive insights
Bayesian Networks: enable understanding of causal relationships within AI models.
Model Confidence: conveying model confidence and uncertainty in predictions.
Adversarial Explanation: testing AI models with intentionally modified inputs to reveal vulnerabilities or biases.
Transfer Learning: widely used for improving AI performance, can also enhance explainability.
Interactive Explanations: allow users to actively engage with AI systems and explore decision pathways.
Integrating Human Feedback Loops: by incorporating iterative feedback loops from human users.
