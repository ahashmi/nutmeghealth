# What Can I Do to Help?

There is clearly a need to _better_ leverage machine learning, artificial intelligence, data scice, and good old fashioned mathematics and statistics in health care. Increasingly, more decisions are being made based on **data**, and there is a greater expectation that questions of all kinds require answers based in data analysis. While this is overall a good trend, it necessitates that we understand the tools, techniques, and concepts well, and that we employ them appropriately with reasonable expectations of their capabilities and limitations.

But, where to start? There is _so_ much data to consider, and the inventory of approaches and algorithms seems to be growing exponentially. The answer lies in starting with understanding the needs of people who use this data and the associated techniques in their daily work in healthcare policy, financing, and delivery. OK, where to look for this information?
